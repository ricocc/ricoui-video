/**
 * Download Remotion's Chrome Headless Shell ahead of time so the first render

 * directly — the `remotion` package has NO CLI binary (that's `@remotion/cli`,
 * which we don't install), so `npx remotion browser ensure` does not work here.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm run remotion:browser` (baked into the Docker / Coolify build).
